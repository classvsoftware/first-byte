A completely pointless Chrome extension that shows the first byte of the HTTP response from the active URL. Install it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/first-byte/nkikhefaobjaccmcngakfmelebahleea).

**[Magically, the reviews this extension has received are overwhelmingly positive!](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/lets-buy-some-fake-chrome-extension)**
